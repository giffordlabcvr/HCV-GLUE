		<h1>HCV-GLUE</h1>
		<h4>A Sequence Data Resource for Hepatitis C Virus</h4>
		<p>
			Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects over 100 million
			people worldwide and can lead to liver
			disease and occasionally cirrhosis. While direct-acting
			antiviral drugs (DAAs) have improved treatment prospects for HCV
			significantly, drug resistance
			has emerged both <em>in vitro</em> and in clinical trials. 
			HCV exhibits a high level of genetic variation and so there is a need for computational 
			resources to organise and analyse existing and new
			HCV sequence data in 
			research, public health and clinical contexts.
		</p>
		<p>HCV-GLUE is a bioinformatics resource for HCV sequence data. The web version can be used for basic analysis. 
		An offline version of the resource can be installed by bioinformaticians and used for more advanced work.</p>

<h3>Web site highlights</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A database of HCV sequences and metadata from NCBI, updated daily and arranged into <a href="#/project/alignment" target="_blank">clades</a> (genotypes, subtypes).</li>
<li>Pre-built multiple-sequence alignments of NCBI sequences, which may be downloaded in user-defined sections.</li>
<li>A database of <a href="#/project/rap" target="_blank">DAA-resistant polymorphisms</a>, 
	developed in collaboration with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/virus-reference-department-vrd">Virus Reference Department at Public Health England</a>.</li>
<li>An <a href="#hcvFastaAnalysis" target="_blank">analysis tool</a> providing genotyping, drug resistance analysis and visualisation of submitted FASTA sequences (<a href="exampleReports/resistanceGeno1.html?hcvGlueVersion=0.1.48" target="_blank">example generated report</a>).</li>
</ul>
</p>
