It enables the dissemination of these hypotheses on the web and the utilisation of the hypotheses in wider software systems. \r\n\r\n### **Included in the HCV-GLUE project**\r\n\r\nA complete genome alignment obtained from [Smith et al (2014)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4063340/) was used to define reference sequences HCV genotypes.\r\n\r\nThe sequences of 3,227 non-redundant HCV isolates were obtained from GenBank and phylogenetically grouped into genotypes. These sequences were then aligned to genotype-specific reference sequences, and the resulting alignments were used to define common polymorphisms within each genotype.\r\n\r\nThis GLUE project also includes the GLUE framework implementation of a [graphical web-based user interface (HCV-GLUE)](http://gluehome.cvr.gla.ac.uk/gluetools-web/www/hcvApp.html#/submitSequencesAnalysis) that uses GLUE to produce interactive reports (Figure 1). Besides highlighting known DRMs, GLUE reports allow users to discriminate unusual mutations from common polymorphisms, and to investigate the frequency of specific mutations in reference datasets. Reports can be interactively configured to display information on a genotype or subtype-specific basis.\r\n\r\n### **Authors and Contributors**\r\n\r\nJosh Singer (josh.singer@glasgow.ac.uk)\r\n\r\nRobert J.
