guideline_1	Package insert	In HCV genotype 1a infected patients with cirrhosis, testing for the presence of the Q80K polymorphism may be considered prior to initiation of therapy with OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir. When considering OLYSIO combination treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin in HCV genotype 1a patients, testing for NS3 Q80K polymorphism should be performed before starting treatment.
guideline_2	EASL	If reliable NS5A resistance testing is performed, treatment-experienced, DAA-naïve patients infected with genotype 1a with or without compensated cirrhosis who have NS5A RASs that confer high-level resistance to ledipasvir (M28A/G/T, Q30E/G/H/K/R, L31M/V, P32L/S, H58D, and/or Y93C/H/N/S) detected at baseline should be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 12 weeks with ribavirin, whereas those without ledipasvir RASs at baseline can be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 12 weeks without ribavirin (B1).
guideline_3	EASL	If reliable NS5A resistance testing is performed, treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients infected with subtype 1a with or without compensated cirrhosis should receive the combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir for 16 weeks with daily weight-based ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg in patients <75 kg or ≥75 kg, respectively) if their HCV RNA level is >800,000 IU/ml and NS5A RASs that confer resistance to elbasvir (M28A/G/T, Q30D/E/G/H/K/L/R, L31F/M/V, H58D and/or Y93C/H/N/S) are present at baseline. Patients infected with subtype 1a with or without compensated cirrhosis with an HCV RNA level ≤800,000 IU/ml and those with an HCV RNA level >800,000 IU/ml without elbasvir NS5A RASs at baseline should receive the combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir for 12 weeks without ribavirin (B1). 
guideline_4	EASL	If reliable NS5A resistance testing is performed, treatment-experienced, DAA-naïve patients infected with genotype 1a with or without compensated cirrhosis with NS5A class RASs detected at baseline should be treated with the combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for 12 weeks with ribavirin, whereas those without NS5A class RASs at baseline can be treated with the combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for 12 weeks without ribavirin (C2).
guideline_5	EASL	If reliable NS5A resistance testing is performed, treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis, as well as treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with compensated cirrhosis, with the NS5A RAS Y93H detectable at baseline should be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks with daily weight-based ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg in patients <75 kg or ≥75 kg, respectively). Patients without the NS5A RAS Y93H at baseline should receive the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks without ribavirin (A1).
guideline_6	EASL	If reliable NS5A resistance testing is performed, treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis with the NS5A RAS Y93H detectable at baseline should be treated with the combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for 12 weeks with daily weight based ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg in patients <75 kg or ≥75 kg, respectively). Patients without the NS5A RASs Y93H at baseline should receive the combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for 12 weeks without ribavirin (B1).
